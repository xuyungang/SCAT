# SCAT
A novel tool package for single-cell RNA sequencing analysis with graph theory and deep networks. It consits of two-step analysis:

## 1. ReadsImpute
### Accurate quantification of transcript for scRNA-seq with read imputation. 


## 2. scIGANs
### recover drop-out events in scRNA-seq using Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) 
Refer to hhttps://github.com/xuyungang/scIGANs for source code and manual.
