# SCAT
A novel tool package for single-cell RNA sequencing analysis with graph theory and deep networks. It consit of two-step analysis:

1. ReadsImpute: Accurate quantification of transcript for scRNA-seq with read imputation. Refer to https://github.com/xuyungang/readsImpute for source code and manual.

2. scIGANs:recover drop-out events in scRNA-seq using Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)
